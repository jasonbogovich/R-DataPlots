h1. R Script that Plots Emission Frequency vs. RNA Concentration & Finds Lambda Max

This is a very short R script I wrote so my fellow chemistry research assistants and I could quickly visualize our fluorescence spectroscopy data and find the most-absorbed frequency, or 'Lambda Max' for each trial.
<br>
It enabled us to quickly inspect our data before continuing with further analysis.
